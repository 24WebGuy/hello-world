# hello-world
hello world is a test case for me to use and learn Git Hub

Love learning new things, science, computing, Git Hub, php, javascript etc, you get the idea...
Developed a site called Code Cobber and I'm in the process of trying to take over the world through it, 
One day I will reap my rewengy (Black Adder 2 reference).

Okay, so it's another day. Just getting to grips with branches, commits
